# About me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cybersecurity to build safer, privacy-first applications. Because trust starts with how you handle data.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI-powered solutions for small business operations. Especially around product tracking, sales insights, and secure data management.
- 🤝 If you have advice, want to team up, or just chat tech? Please feel free to reach out!

- ⚡ Fun fact: Grew up watching only Disney and Pixar on a box TV. Maybe that’s why I believe great experiences should be simple, clear, and accessible.
