# About me

- 🔭 I'm currently building a secure web app to help small businesses manage resale inventory. Passionate about empowering small teams with accessible, impactful tech.
- 🌱 Deepening my knowledge in cybersecurity to create safer, privacy-first applications. Because trust starts with how you handle data.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on AI-powered solutions for small business operations, especially in product tracking, sales insights, and secure data management.
- 🤝 Got advice, want to team up, or just chat tech? I'd love to hear from you!
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I'm always up for a good conversation.
- 📫 Reach me at: Nicole.Scheid@protonmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Grew up watching only Disney and Pixar on a box TV. Maybe that’s why I believe great experiences should be simple, clear, and accessible.
